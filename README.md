Komodo (Kontinuum Dislocation on Moose Framework)
=====

As shown in [Wu R., Sandfeld S. (2016) Some Steps towards Modelling of Dislocation Assisted Rafting: A Coupled 2D Phase Field â€” Continuum Dislocation Dynamics Approach. In: The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (eds) TMS 2016 145th Annual Meeting & Exhibition. Springer, Cham](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-48254-5_77#citeas) the initial dislocation has to be generated in order to couple with Phase Field Method.

Initial dislocation will be generated by the gaussian distribution(1D or 2D scalar field) within the system, then will be calculated the slip distribution on the system. Finally, we ought to calculate initial Eigenstrain due to the dislocation.

Various objects handling this work such as
  - AuxKernels/GaussianDislocationDensity (generate 1D dislocation density)
  - AuxKernels/GaussianDislocation2DDensity (generate 2D dislocation density scalar field)
  - AuxKernels/SlipElement (calculate Slip distribution element)
  - Materials/ComputeDislocationDensityEigenstrain (Materials object to calculate eigenstrain)

Example of using Komodo
  - Positive Dislocation, negative dislocation, positive-negative dislocation test/tests/materials
